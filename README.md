# spotihack

This was a project created in a period of ~24 hours for the *[Hack the Holidays](https://hacktheholidays.io/) 2* event.

The goal of the project was to fetch the songs of user's Spotify playlisti and, by parsing the lyrics and learning from the melodies of MIDI files, algorithmically generate a new song with influence, which would then be played back in the browser with a WebGL visualiser and interface.

In the end, the result was not as cohesive as this vision but several of the individual parts were well formed, such as Spotify integration, a WebGL interface and lyrics generation utilising markov chains.
